        <h2>Instillation & Deployment</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&nbsp;If you would like to start the APM-Dashboard you will need a few things to get set up:
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/Conlonc2/APM-Dashboard.git">APM-Dashboard
                        Project</a>: The project would be a good place to start. To acquire this you can run
                    <code>git clone https://github.com/Conlonc2/APM-Dashboard.git</code></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>: this is used to access our
                    Angular side of the
                    application.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>: For the database.</li>
            </ul>
            &emsp;&nbsp;Once the above are on your machine please run <code>cd /path/to/project/<b><u>ClientApp</u></b></code>. Once in the
            proper
            directory run the following:
            <code>npm install</code>. Once done you should be ready to start the server/front-end. To start the server
            from the same directory as above you can run <code>npm start</code> OR <code>ng server</code>, as you should
            also have the <i>Angular CLI</i> installed from the previous commands. (Note: if you do not have the
            <i>Angular CLI</i> installed you can run <code>npm install @angluar/cli</code>)
        </p>
        <h2>Features of APM-Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp;&nbsp;The APM-Dashboard was a request from <a href="https://www.selective.com/"><i>Selective
                    Insurance</i></a> so
            that they may view team statistics on current projects. The dashboard is to be displayed in key locations
            around the office so that teams could see how they are doing in respect to there projects. There are a total
            of eight tiles.

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            &emsp;&nbsp;Each one of these tiles are displayed on a per-team basis. In the areas common to multiple
            teams the
            dashboard will rotate through each team, thus allowing each team to peek at their statistics for a brief
            time.
